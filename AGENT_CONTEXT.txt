AGENT CONTEXT - CBM PLASTICS MERCH SHOP
========================================

PROJECT HISTORY
---------------
This project was duplicated from another MerchShop project located at:
C:\Users\jorda\OneDrive\Documents\MerchShop

The duplication was completed on [today's date]. This is a completely standalone project with:
- Separate folder: CBMPlasticsMerchShop (sibling to original MerchShop)
- Separate database (needs new Supabase project)
- Separate hosting (will deploy to separate Vercel project)
- Independent codebase (no monorepo dependencies)

WHAT WAS ALREADY DONE
--------------------
✅ Project structure duplicated from the original app/
✅ packages/core copied into this project
✅ All imports updated from 'core' to local paths (./packages/core or relative paths)
✅ Branding updated:
   - App name: "CBM Store"
   - Company: "CBM Plastics"
   - Primary color: #00467F (blue)
   - Secondary color: #00467F (blue - replaces orange)
   - Logo path: /CBM Logo.png
✅ package.json updated (removed monorepo workspace reference)
✅ tsconfig.json updated (paths point to local packages/core)
✅ next.config.js updated (removed monorepo references)
✅ vercel.json updated (standalone build commands)
✅ globals.css updated (colors changed to #00467F)
✅ .env.local.example created

WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE
---------------------------
1. ADD LOGO FILE
   - User needs to add "CBM Logo.png" to the public/ folder
   - Or update branding.ts if using a different filename

2. CREATE SUPABASE PROJECT
   - Create new Supabase project at https://app.supabase.com
   - Name it something like "CBM Plastics Merch Shop"
   - Choose region (same as original for consistency if possible)

3. RUN DATABASE MIGRATIONS
   - Go to SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
   - Run migrations in order from supabase/migrations/:
     * 001_initial_schema.sql
     * 002_rls_policies.sql
     * 003_seed_data.sql (optional - creates sample products)
     * Any other migrations in numerical order (004, 005, etc.)

4. GET SUPABASE CREDENTIALS
   - Go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy: Project URL, anon/public key, service_role key

5. CREATE .env.local FILE
   - Copy .env.local.example to .env.local
   - Fill in Supabase credentials:
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

6. CREATE FIRST ADMIN USER
   - In Supabase dashboard: Authentication > Users > Add User
   - Create user with email/password
   - In SQL Editor, run:
     UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-admin@company.com';

7. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES AND TEST
   - Run: pnpm install
   - Run: pnpm dev
   - Test login with admin credentials
   - Verify branding appears correctly (blue colors, CBM branding)

8. DEPLOY TO VERCEL (when ready)
   - Create new Vercel project
   - Connect this repository
   - Add environment variables (same as .env.local)
   - Deploy

TECH STACK
----------
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Supabase (Auth + PostgreSQL with RLS)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- pnpm (standalone, not monorepo)

KEY FILES
---------
- branding.ts - CBM Plastics branding configuration
- app/layout.tsx - Uses cbmBranding
- packages/core/ - Local copy of shared UI components
- supabase/migrations/ - Database migrations (run these in new Supabase project)

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
- This is NOT a monorepo - it's a standalone Next.js app
- All imports use local paths (./packages/core or relative paths)
- Colors are blue (#00467F) throughout - orange was replaced
- Logo file needs to be added to public/ folder
- Separate Supabase project required (don't use the original project's database)
- Separate Vercel deployment (don't deploy to the original project's Vercel)

If you encounter any issues with imports or paths, check that files are importing from:
- './packages/core/components/...' (for files in root app/)
- '../../packages/core/components/...' (for files in app/(app)/, app/(admin)/, etc.)
- '../../../packages/core/components/...' (for deeper nested files)

The project structure is identical to the original, just with updated branding and standalone configuration.
